The XZ backdoor refers to a malicious backdoor that was introduced to the Linux build of the xz utility in 2024, giving an attacker remote code execution capabilities on affected systems. It was discovered by a software developer and has a high CVSS score. Backdoors are covert methods of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer or device, often used for securing remote access or obtaining privileged information. They can take various forms and can be created deliberately or unintentionally. Recent proposals to counter backdoors include creating a database and using neural networks to detect them.
