The XZ backdoor is a malicious vulnerability that was introduced to the Linux build of the xz utility in 2024, allowing remote code execution on affected systems. It was discovered by software developer Andres Freund and was present in development versions of major Linux distributions. Backdoors are covert methods of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer or device, and are often used for securing remote access or obtaining privileged information. They can take various forms, such as hidden parts of programs or default passwords, and can be deliberately installed or secretly inserted by hackers. To counter backdoors, proposals have been made to create a database of their triggers and use neural networks to detect them.
