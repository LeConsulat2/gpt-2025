      "\n",
      "### Cultural Considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "In New Zealand, OTs are also mindful of the cultural context, particularly the needs of Māori youth. The principles of Te Whare Tapa Whā (the four cornerstones of health: taha wairua/spiritual, taha hinengaro/mental, taha tinana/physical, and taha whānau/family) are often integrated into practice to ensure culturally responsive care.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Occupational therapists in New Zealand play a vital role in addressing the complex mental health and psychological issues faced by youth aged 12 to 24. Through a combination of assessment, intervention, and collaboration, OTs help young individuals navigate their mental health challenges, enhance their daily functioning, and improve their overall quality of life. By focusing on meaningful engagement in activities and fostering resilience, OTs contribute significantly to the mental well-being of New Zealand's youth."

      "\n",
      "### 6. **Family and Community Involvement**\n",
